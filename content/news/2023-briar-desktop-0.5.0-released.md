title: 'Briar Desktop 0.5.0-beta released - macOS support, private groups and Briar Mailbox'
---

The desktop team is excited to announce the next update to the Briar desktop
client.
The new version 0.5.0-beta brings support for private groups that
complement private messaging and forums. Private groups were previously
only available on Android devices.

Another update is the ability to link a Briar Mailbox to your desktop
client. The Mailbox is an Android app that accompanies Briar and
[was released just two weeks ago](/news/2023-briar-mailbox-released/).
With a Mailbox linked to your Briar
messenger you can improve your own reachability and better reach your contacts.
While messages usually only get exchanged while you're online at the same
time as your contacts, a Mailbox can receive messages from your contacts
while you're offline and Briar will safely fetch them next time you come online.
Similarly, you can send messages to your contacts while they are
offline - your Mailbox will store them and allow your contacts to
fetch them even if you're offline later on.

Last but not least, the new version also brings support for the next
major operating system: macOS.
We're very happy to bring Briar to even more users and are looking
forward to any feedback you have.
