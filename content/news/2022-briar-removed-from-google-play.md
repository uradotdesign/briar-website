## Status update

**Update (February 28, 13:20 UTC): Briar is available on Google Play again.**

Briar was briefly removed from Google Play because we didn't provide Google's review team with a username and password for testing the app. We provided Google with a username and password for testing and the app is now available again.

## About Briar

Briar is a messaging app designed for activists, journalists,
and anyone else who needs a safe, easy and robust way to communicate.
Unlike traditional messaging tools such as email, Twitter or Telegram,
Briar doesn't rely on a central server -
messages are synchronized directly between the users' devices.
If the internet's down,
Briar can sync via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi, keeping the information flowing in a crisis.
If the internet's up, Briar can sync via the Tor network, protecting users
and their relationships from surveillance.
