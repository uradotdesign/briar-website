title: Building the Source Code
---

1\) Download and install [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html).

2\) Launch Android Studio and select **Get from Version Control** from the Welcome Screen.

3\) Another screen pops up. Ensure that **Version control** is set to **Git**.

4\) For the **URL**, enter **https\://code.briarproject.org/briar/briar.git** if you want to build Briar, or **https\://code.briarproject.org/briar/briar-mailbox.git** if you want to build Briar Mailbox. Then click **Clone**.

This process may take a while, and you should see a dialog similar to this.

5\) When the source code has downloaded, components will be loaded and the project will open in an Android Studio workspace.

6\) Wait for Gradle to sync. 

You may be unable to build the project due to the error: **It is not fully supported to define distributionSha256Sum in gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties...**

To resolve this error, look in the **Event Log** for a link that says **Use "c9490e938..." as checksum for https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-7.3.3-all.zip and sync project**. Click the link to continue building the project.

It takes several minutes to download, install, verify and configure the required packages and tools. If the sync process fails at any point, select **Sync project with Gradle Files** from the **File** menu to restart the process.

7\) Follow [Android Studio's documentation](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/device) to set up a device to run your app on. 

8\) If a device has been properly set up, you should see it under **Running devices** in the target device drop-down menu. Select the device and click run button (or select **Run** > **Run 'briar-android'** from the menu).

Android Studio builds the app, then installs and launches it under the name "Briar Debug" on the selected device.

## Updating

9\) Briar is under constant development, so you should check for updates
regularly. To get the latest version of the source code, select **VCS** > **Update Project**.

Alternatively, you can also use the **Update Project** button on the toolbar:
