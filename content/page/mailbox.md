Briar Mailbox is a helper app for Briar messenger that lets you receive
encrypted messages from your contacts while Briar is offline. Next time Briar
comes online it will automatically fetch the messages from your Mailbox.

Likewise, you can send encrypted messages to contacts who are offline, and
the messages will be delivered automatically when your contacts come online.

To set up a Mailbox, simply install the Mailbox app on a spare Android device,
link it with your Briar account by scanning a QR code, and leave the Mailbox
device connected to power and Wi-Fi.

If you prefer not to use Google Play, you can [install the app via
F-Droid](/fdroid) or [download the APK file](/apk) directly from
our site.
