We're looking for volunteers to contribute to all aspects of the
project, including design, development, documentation, translation and
testing. We're happy to provide guidance or mentoring for less
experienced contributors.

If you're interested in getting involved or following the progress of
the project, please [join the development mailing
list](https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/briar-devel)
or email {{<contactemail>}}.
You can also join our chat channel using
[IRC](ircs://irc.libera.chat:6697/briar) (#briar on libera.chat
or [OFTC](ircs://irc.oftc.net:6697/briar)) or
[Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#briar:matrix.org).
Translators can volunteer through our [Transifex
project](https://transifex.com/otf/briar).

All our software is open source - you can [browse the source
code](https://code.briarproject.org/briar/briar/tree/master) or [build
the app from source](/building).

All contributors must adhere to the [code of conduct](/code-of-conduct).
